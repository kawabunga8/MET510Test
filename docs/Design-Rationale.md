# Design Rationale (Draft)

## Project
**Critical Thinking for High-Schoolers (ETEC 510)** — Unity prototype

This project explores a **gamified “detective toolkit”** for Grade 10 learners. Students work through short cases using a structured set of critical thinking tools (claim/evidence separation, credibility checks, bias/intent analysis) and receive feedback in a way that supports learning through mistakes.

## Learners and context
- **Target learners:** Grade 10 students
- **Intended learning space:** Career Studies (or similar advisory / digital citizenship integration)
- **Context constraints:** desktop/laptop access; high visual literacy; preference for short, engaging multimedia and interactive tasks.

## Design goals
1. **Engagement through story and agency**: Students take the role of Lead Detective to make choices that meaningfully affect outcomes.
2. **Safe mistakes with immediate feedback**: The tool is designed so errors are informative rather than punitive.
3. **Scaffolds for higher-quality thinking**: Learners receive structured prompts and tools to move beyond “gut feeling” and toward reasoned judgment.
4. **Accessibility and multiple pathways**: Where possible, content is presented in multiple modalities (audio/video + text support).

## Theory connections (course alignment)
### Participatory culture and critical engagement (Jenkins, 2009)
Jenkins argues that access to technology is not enough; learners need skills and cultural knowledge to use tools critically and ethically. This prototype responds by explicitly teaching and rehearsing **credibility and intent** checks in digital contexts (e.g., distinguishing “professional” appearing sources from credible ones; examining commercial influence).

### Critical Thinking Thematic Framework (Shafer, 2025)
Shafer’s three thematic lenses inform the design of the case flow:
- **Pragmatic lens (reasoning):** learners evaluate claims, evidence, and source signals.
- **Dispositional lens (reflection):** learners reflect on decision-making, receive feedback, and revise thinking.
- **Transformational lens (agency):** learners exercise choice in the investigation, building confidence and ownership.

## Prototype scope (MVP)
The MVP aims to deliver **one playable 10–15 minute case** that demonstrates the full loop:
1. Briefing (audio/video)
2. Evidence review
3. Toolkit actions
4. Decision + feedback
5. Reflection prompt
6. XP/badges/progress

## Next steps
- Implement the MVP case flow and UI in Unity.
- Develop a small set of evidence assets and short briefing clips.
- Conduct quick playtests (2–3 learners) and iterate based on feedback.
